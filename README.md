# Cookstyle ChatGPT Task

This repository contains my task submission for the Cookstyle open-source project.  
I added a **custom cop** to detect deprecated usage of the `execute` resource in Chef cookbooks, along with its test file.

## Files

- `deprecated_execute_resource.rb` → Custom Cookstyle cop
- `deprecated_execute_resource_spec.rb` → RSpec test for the cop

## How ChatGPT Helped

- Understand the Cookstyle codebase
- Generate the basic structure for the cop
- Helped with test scaffolding and documentation

## Video Walkthrough

I recorded a **5-minute video** explaining:

1. What Cookstyle is  
2. The new rule I added  
3. How I used ChatGPT to assist  
4. Test walkthrough  
5. Reflection on the task
